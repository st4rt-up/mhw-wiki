A diagonal upwards swing starting from the left of the hunter, builds a quarter note.
Useful as a quick punish and can snipe heads that are high to the right of you, usually outclassed by Right Swing.

An overhead slam leaving the hunting horn on the ground in front of the hunter
Hits high up so good for hitting airborne enemies, is rather slow so can be used to snipe heads after a stagger, one of your longest range punishes. Should almost always be cancelled into another attack or a roll.
